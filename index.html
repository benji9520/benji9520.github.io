<h1>Benjamin Mathis - An Introduction</h1>
<hr>
<h2> A little about myself...</h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Ben Mathis and I hope to learn all of the basics regarding web development while taking this course, in conjunction with my other classes. I have always been interested in computers from pretty early on. We didn't really have internet until I was in 7th grade, but my brothers and I would play computer games via LAN basically all summer long. My goal after Tri-C is to obtain a job in the IT field, preferably working on more back end stuff. Two of my biggest goals are to open and maintain an animal rescue as well as hike all of the Applalachian Trail.</p>
